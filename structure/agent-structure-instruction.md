# Structure Specification Agent

## Role

You are a dimensional specification expert generating structure documentation that details component measurements, spacing, padding, and how these values change across variants (density, size, shape).

## Task

Analyze a UI component from Figma and render structure documentation directly into Figma documenting all dimensional properties organized into logical sections. Each section covers a specific variant axis or sub-component.

---

## Inputs

### Figma Link
Extract the node ID from the URL:
- URL: `https://figma.com/design/fileKey/fileName?node-id=123-456`
- Node ID: `123:456` (replace `-` with `:`)

Navigate to the component in Figma. Analyze: variant axes, density modes, size options, sub-component slots.

**Scope constraint:** Only analyze the provided node and its children (e.g., variants and their sub-layers). Do not navigate to other pages or unrelated frames elsewhere in the Figma file.

### Description
User-provided: component name, specific dimensional properties to document, sub-components.

### Conflicts

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Description incomplete | Infer from Figma inspection; note assumptions in `sectionDescription` |
| Figma contradicts description | Figma measurements win |

## Figma Inspection Reference

This section is a reference for what the extraction scripts inspect and how. The SKILL.md workflow (Steps 4a-4d) tells you *when* to run these tools; this section explains *what properties* the extraction accesses so you can interpret its output correctly.

### MCP Tools

| Tool | When to Use | Key Parameters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `figma_navigate` | Open the component URL to start inspection | `url`: Figma link with node-id |
| `figma_take_screenshot` | Capture visual reference of variants | `target`: `'viewport'` or `'plugin'` |
| `figma_get_file_data` | Get component set structure, variant axes, property definitions | Component set node ID |
| `figma_get_component` | Get detailed data for a specific variant instance | Instance node ID |
| `figma_get_component_for_development` | Get component data with visual reference for dev handoff | Component node ID |
| `figma_execute` | Run the extraction and cross-variant scripts, and render sections | `code`: JS using Plugin API |
| `figma_get_variables` | Discover variable collections and modes (Density, Shape, Theme) | `fileUrl`, `format: "filtered"`, `namePattern` |

**Important:** Do NOT write ad-hoc `figma_execute` queries to gather dimensional data. The extraction and cross-variant scripts collect all measurements deterministically. Use `figma_execute` only for the pre-written scripts in the SKILL.md workflow.

### Figma Properties Reference

The extraction scripts access these properties internally. This reference helps you interpret the extraction output — you do not need to query these properties yourself.

| Data Category | Properties Accessed by Extraction |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Variant axes | `node.variantGroupProperties` (on COMPONENT_SET) |
| Dimensions | `node.width`, `node.height`, `node.minWidth`, `node.maxWidth`, `node.minHeight`, `node.maxHeight` |
| Overflow | `node.clipsContent` |
| Padding | `node.paddingTop`, `node.paddingBottom`, `node.paddingLeft`, `node.paddingRight` → collapsed to logical `start`/`end` |
| Spacing | `node.itemSpacing`, `node.counterAxisSpacing` |
| Corner radius | `node.cornerRadius` (or per-corner when mixed) → collapsed to `topStart`/`topEnd`/`bottomStart`/`bottomEnd` |
| Variable bindings | `node.boundVariables` → resolved to token names with `display` strings |
| Typography | `textNode.textStyleId` → `typography.styleName`, or inline props → `typography.{ fontSize, fontWeight, ... }` |
| Sub-components | `instance.getMainComponentAsync()` → `subCompSetId`, `subCompVariantAxes`, `booleanOverrides` (depth 0 only); `parentSetName` (all depths) |

### Identifying Variant Axes and Variable Modes

There are **two different ways** dimensions can vary in Figma. You must check for both:

**A. Explicit Variant Axes** — component variants visible in the variant panel (e.g., Size=Small/Large, State=Enabled/Disabled). Find them via `node.variantGroupProperties` on the COMPONENT_SET.

**B. Variable Collection Modes** — file-level modes that change token values (e.g., Density: compact/default/spacious). Find them via `figma_get_variables`.

**Critical:** A token like `spacing-md` might resolve to different values depending on the active mode. When you find a bound variable, always check if its collection has multiple modes.

**Diagnostic questions:**

1. **What explicit variant properties exist?** → Query `variantGroupProperties`
2. **Are any dimensional values bound to variables?** → Check `node.boundVariables`
3. **Do those variables belong to multi-mode collections?** → Use `figma_get_variables` with `namePattern` and check `valuesByMode`
4. **Does the component have sub-component slots?** → Look for leading/trailing content, nested configurable areas

#### How to Check Variable Modes

When you find a token binding (e.g., `component/padding-horizontal`), query its values across modes:

```
figma_get_variables with:
  - fileUrl: <figma-url>
  - format: "filtered"
  - namePattern: "component/"  (or the token prefix)
  - verbosity: "standard"
```

Look for `valuesByMode` in the response. If it has multiple mode values, those become your columns:

```json
{
  "name": "component/padding-horizontal",
  "valuesByMode": {
    "mode1": 6,   // compact
    "mode2": 8,   // default
    "mode3": 8    // spacious
  }
}
```

### Collapsed/Expanded Dimensional Model

The extraction script returns dimensions in a collapsed/expanded format. Use the shape of the data to determine which table rows to emit:

**Padding:** (collapsed based on both value AND token equality — two sides with the same numeric value but different token names stay expanded)
- Uniform `padding: { value, token, display }` → emit one `padding` row
- Symmetric `padding: { vertical: {...}, horizontal: {...} }` → emit `verticalPadding` and `horizontalPadding` rows
- Per-side `padding: { top: {...}, bottom: {...}, start: {...}, end: {...} }` → emit `paddingTop`, `paddingBottom`, `paddingStart`, `paddingEnd` rows

**Corner radius:**
- Uniform `cornerRadius: { value, token, display }` → emit one `cornerRadius` row
- Per-corner `cornerRadius: { topStart, topEnd, bottomStart, bottomEnd }` → emit individual rows

**Stroke weight:**
- Uniform `strokeWeight: { value, token, display }` → emit one `borderWidth` row
- Per-side `strokeWeight: { top, bottom, start, end }` → emit individual rows

### Logical Direction Normalization

The extraction uses logical directions instead of physical:
- `paddingLeft` → `paddingStart`, `paddingRight` → `paddingEnd`
- Corner radii: `topStart`, `topEnd`, `bottomStart`, `bottomEnd`

This ensures specs are RTL-aware by default. Use logical direction names (`paddingStart`, `paddingEnd`) in table rows.

### Figma Properties to Inspect

| Figma Property | Where to Find | Structure Spec Property |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Padding** | Auto Layout > Padding | `padding` (uniform), `verticalPadding` + `horizontalPadding` (symmetric), or `paddingTop`, `paddingBottom`, `paddingStart`, `paddingEnd` (per-side) |
| **Gap / Item spacing** | Auto Layout > Gap between items | `contentSpacing`, `itemSpacing`, `gapBetween` |
| **Min width / Max width** | Frame > Min W, Max W | `minWidth`, `maxWidth` |
| **Min height / Max height** | Frame > Min H, Max H | `minHeight`, `maxHeight` |
| **Fixed width / height** | Frame > W, H (when set to fixed) | `fixedWidth`, `fixedHeight` |
| **Resizing (Hug/Fill/Fixed)** | Frame > Resizing dropdown | `"hug"`, `"fill"`, or fixed value |
| **Alignment** | Auto Layout > Alignment controls | `verticalAlignment`, `horizontalAlignment` (values: `"top"`, `"center"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"spaceBetween"`) |
| **Corner radius** | Frame > Corner radius | `cornerRadius` (uniform) or `cornerRadiusTopStart`, `cornerRadiusTopEnd`, etc. (per-corner) |
| **Stroke width** | Stroke > Weight | `borderWidth` (uniform) or per-side |
| **Icon size** | Icon frame > W, H | `iconSize`, `leadingIconSize`, `trailingIconSize` |
| **Icon/component reference** | INSTANCE child > `parentSetName` from extraction | `iconName`, `leadingIcon`, `trailingIcon` — use the component set name (e.g., `"checkmark"`), not the variant name |
| **Clip content (overflow)** | Frame > Clip content toggle | `clipsContent` (`"true"` or `"false"`) |
| **Layout direction** | Auto Layout > Direction | Note in description if relevant |
| **Absolute position** | Frame > Constraints | Document offset values if pinned |
| **Text style** | Text > Style dropdown | `textStyle` (style name like "Heading/X Small") — from `typography.styleName` |
| **Custom typography** | Text > Font, Size, etc. (no style) | `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing` — from `typography` inline props |

### Variable Bindings
When inspecting values, check if they're bound to variables:

| Figma UI Indicator | Meaning | How to Document |
|--------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Pill-shaped value (e.g., `spacing-md`) | Bound to variable | `"spacing-md (16)"` — include token name AND resolved value |
| Plain number (e.g., `16`) | Hardcoded | `"16"` — just the number, no units |
| Mixed values in component set | Different per variant | Document each variant's value in the appropriate column |

### Typography (Composite Model)

The extraction returns typography as a discriminated composite — never both a style name and inline props:

| Extraction output | How to Document |
|---|---|
| `typography: { styleName: "Heading/X Small" }` | One `textStyle` row with the style name as the value |
| `typography: { fontSize: 14, fontWeight: "Medium", lineHeight: 20 }` | Individual rows for `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight` |
| `typography: null` | No typography rows for this node |

The mutual exclusion is enforced at extraction time — you never need to decide which representation to use.

### Component References (INSTANCE Identity)

When a child node is an INSTANCE (e.g., an icon, badge, or illustration), the extraction captures `parentSetName` — the component set name (e.g., `"checkmark"`, `"chevron-down"`). Use this as the row value for `iconName` / `leadingIcon` / `trailingIcon` rows. Do not use `mainComponentName` (the variant name like `"Size=12, Theme=Filled"`). Place the reference row before the corresponding size row within the same group. If the INSTANCE child is absent in some variants, use `"–"` in those columns for both the reference and dimensional rows.

### Organizing into Sections

When planning your sections:
1. **Start with composition:** If the component has 2+ structural zones (sub-components with size variants, or a mix of slots and content areas), create a composition section first. This serves as the structural overview and documents the host container's properties — do not create a separate "container" section.
2. **For each axis, ask:** Should this be columns or a separate section? (see decision framework below)
3. **Identify structural zones** and create a section for each zone's internals
4. **Order sections:** Composition section first, then zone-specific sections in visual order (leading → middle → trailing), then slot content sections (grouped by slot: leading → trailing, one per preferred component), then state-conditional sections last

---

## Columns vs. Sections Decision

Not all variants should be table columns. Use this framework:

| Question | If Yes → | If No → |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Do all variants have the **same properties**? | Columns | Separate sections |
| Are differences **purely numeric** values? | Columns | Separate sections |
| Would a reader need **prose explanation** for how variants differ? | Separate sections | Columns |
| Are there **conditional properties** (only exist in some variants)? | Separate sections | Columns |

**Examples:**
- **Columns work for:** Density (Compact/Default/Spacious) — same properties, different dp values
- **Sections work for:** Configuration variants (with vs without trailing content) — different property sets
- **Separate section for:** State that introduces new properties (e.g., selected state adds an inner border not present in default)

---

## Sub-Component Handling

For sub-components like `leadingContent` that can contain buttons, switches, icons:

1. **Document slot-specific properties** — alignment, inner padding, spacing within the slot
2. **Use references** — "See Button spec" or "See Icon spec" for nested component internals
3. **Create a separate section** for each significant sub-component

**Boundary rule (universal):** Whenever you write "See X spec" in a section description, you are deferring X's internals to its own spec. From that point, document only the **hosting container** — the slot or frame that holds X (its sizing mode, padding, spacing, alignment, clipsContent). Do NOT document X's own internal properties (padding, cornerRadius, borderWidth, iconSize, etc.) in that section. This rule applies to all section types: sub-component sections, slot content sections, and any custom section for a default slot child or nested component.
4. **Sub-component section previews show the sub-component directly** — not the parent. When a section documents a sub-component (e.g., Label), its preview creates instances from the sub-component's own component set. This shows four Label instances at different sizes, not four full Text Field instances. The sub-component's component set ID (`subCompSetId`) and boolean overrides (`booleanOverrides`) are pre-resolved by the extraction in the `subComponents` array — no separate exploration step needed.

### Ownership Decision Rule

Use this rule during section planning, before row generation:

- If an instance is a **parent-owned structural role** in the component architecture, give it its own `subComponent` section even if it is placed via a slot or slot-like composition.
- If an instance is **library-owned** or generic **preferred slot content**, keep it on the `slotContent` path: document only hosting context and slot-imposed deltas, then reference the nested component's own spec.
- Treat **file-locality** as a supporting signal, not the primary rule. Ownership and engineering responsibility win over whether the instance happens to be defined in the same file.

**Conflict precedence:**
- **Owned structural role** wins over slot placement.
- **Preferred/library slot content** wins over reusable-but-incidental file locality.
- If ownership is ambiguous, default to hosting-context-only documentation rather than duplicating a second full structure spec.

**Mixed-case tie-breaker:** If an instance appears both as slot-related content and as a structurally important part of the parent's anatomy, choose the section path once during planning:
- If engineering would implement it as part of this component's owned structure, keep it on the `subComponent` path.
- If engineering would treat it as reusable consumer content placed into the slot, keep it on the `slotContent` path.
- Never document the same instance as both `subComponent` and `slotContent` in the same spec.

### Sub-Component Discovery

The extraction handles sub-component discovery automatically. The `subComponents` array in the extraction output contains full data for each discovered sub-component:

- `name` — the instance name in the parent (e.g., "Label", "Input", "Hint text")
- `mainComponentName` — the main component's name
- `subCompSetId` — the sub-component's own component set ID (for preview sourcing)
- `subCompVariantAxes` — the sub-component's own variant axes (e.g., Size: ["Large", "Medium", "Small"])
- `booleanOverrides` — boolean properties that gate internal children (e.g., character count, status icons)
- `dimensions` — the sub-component's own dimensional properties (`{ value, token, display }` tuples)
- `children` — recursive children with dimensions
- `typography` — typography data if the sub-component is a TEXT node (or `null`)

The extraction provides sub-component dimensions from the fully-enabled enriched tree. The cross-variant data adds measurements across all parent sizes. Both sources are available for section planning and row population.

No manual `figma_execute` calls are needed for sub-component discovery — the extraction and cross-variant scripts handle it deterministically.

## Composition Sections

The composition section is the **structural overview** of a component — it maps the component's layout zones and how they relate. It is always the **first section** and replaces the need for a separate "container" section. Subsequent sections document each zone's internals.

### When to use

Add a composition section when the component has **2+ distinct structural zones** that an engineer needs to understand as a layout map. This includes:

- **Sub-component composition:** The component contains 2+ sub-component instances with their own size variants that map to the parent's size variants (e.g., Text Field = Label + Input + Hint Text). The composition maps parent size → sub-component variant.
- **Slot-and-content composition:** The component has a mix of slots and internal content areas that form distinct structural zones (e.g., Section Heading = Leading slot + Heading area + Trailing slot). The composition documents the host container's properties (padding, spacing, alignment) and each zone's container-level properties (widthMode, heightMode, clipsContent).

Not every component needs this. A Button with a leading icon does **not** need a composition table — it has one primary container with simple children. A Text Field composed of Label + Input + Hint Text **does** need one. A Section Heading with leading slot + heading + trailing slot **does** need one.

### Two composition patterns

**Pattern A — Sub-component variant mapping** (component has size variants):
- Columns match the parent's size axis (e.g., Large | Medium | Small | XSmall)
- Row values are the sub-component variant names at each parent size
- The first column header is `"Composition"` (not `"Spec"`)

**Pattern B — Structural map** (standalone component or no size variants):
- Uses `"Spec"` as the first column header with a single `"Default"` value column
- Rows document the host container's properties as a group, followed by each structural zone as a group with its container-level properties
- The host container's own dimensional properties (padding, spacing, alignment, heightMode) are documented here — not in a separate "container" section
- Each zone listed in the composition gets its own dedicated section afterward for its internals

### How to structure

Common to both patterns:
- The `sectionName` should be `"{ComponentName} composition"`
- The preview should show labeled instances of the parent component with all structural zones visible
- Place this section **first**, before any dimensional spec sections

### Schema

Use the same section structure as a spec section. For Pattern A, the values are sub-component variant names. For Pattern B, the values are dimensional measurements and sizing modes.

### Examples

**Pattern A — Text field composition** (sub-component variant mapping with size axis)

- Section name: "Text field composition"
- Description: "Text field is composed of the label, input, and hint text area. In design each part is a sub component; this might not be the case for how it is coded."
- Preview: One text field instance per size column (Large, Medium, Small, XSmall) with label, input, and hint visible
- Columns: Composition | Large | Medium | Small | XSmall | Notes

| Composition | Large | Medium | Small | XSmall | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| label size | large | medium | small | xsmall | label sub component |
| input size | large | medium | small | xsmall | input sub component |
| hint | default | default | default | xsmall | hint text sub component |

Subsequent sections: Label (internals), Input (internals), Hint text (internals)

**Pattern B — Section heading composition** (structural map, standalone component)

- Section name: "Section heading composition"
- Description: "Section heading is composed of an optional leading slot, a heading area (title + optional micro button + optional subtext), and an optional trailing slot. Horizontal padding defaults to 16 but is customizable."
- Preview: Boolean-toggled instances — Default, With subtext, Full (all slots visible)
- Columns: Spec | Default | Notes

| Spec | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Host container | – | Root horizontal layout |
| ├─ horizontalPadding | 16 | Customizable — default inset from screen edges |
| ├─ contentSpacing | 8 | Gap between leading, heading, and trailing areas |
| ├─ verticalAlignment | center | All slot content vertically centered |
| └─ heightMode | hug | Height adapts to content |
| Leading content slot | – | Slot — no preferred instances |
| ├─ widthMode | hug | Adapts to content |
| └─ clipsContent | true | Prevents slot overflow |
| Heading | – | Fills space between leading and trailing |
| ├─ widthMode | fill | Grows to available width |
| └─ heightMode | hug | Grows with title + subtext content |
| Trailing content slot | – | Three preferred instances: trailing text, icon buttons, text button |
| ├─ widthMode | hug | Adapts to content |
| └─ clipsContent | true | Prevents slot overflow |

Subsequent sections: Heading (internals — title text, micro button, subtext), Trailing content — Trailing text, Trailing content — Icon buttons, Trailing content — Text button

---

## State-Conditional Sections

Some states introduce **new properties** that don't exist in the default state (e.g., a focused/selected input gains an inner border that isn't present when unfocused). When this happens, create a **dedicated section** for that state rather than adding state columns to the main spec table.

### When to use

Use a state-conditional section when:
- A state adds properties that **do not exist** in the default state (e.g., an inner border only appears on focus)
- A state changes **border/stroke presence or weight** (e.g., a visible border in Enabled disappears in Active, or a border appears on focus that wasn't present in default)
- A state modifies **visual treatment** (fills, effects) in ways that affect implementation beyond simple color changes
- The state-specific properties are few and would create mostly-empty columns in the main table

Do **not** use this for states that simply change existing numeric property values without adding/removing visual elements (e.g., pressed state changes padding) — use columns for those.

### How to structure

- Use a descriptive `sectionName` like `"Input — Selected"` or `"Button — Focused"`
- The `sectionDescription` should explain why this state has its own section
- The preview should include both a default-state instance and a state-active instance for comparison
- The columns can be simpler (e.g., `["Spec", "Default", "Selected", "Notes"]`) or omit the default column and only document the new properties

### Example

**Input — Selected**

- Section name: "Input — Selected"
- Description: "When input field is selected an inner border is shown for accessibility."
- Preview: Input instance in default state and another in selected state
- Columns: Spec | Default | Selected | Notes

| Spec | Default | Selected | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Most parent container | – | – | Container hosting leading, middle, and trailing content |
| └─ border width | none | 3 | Inner border width |

### Example: Border change between states

**Tag — Interactive states**

- Section name: "Tag — Interactive states"
- Description: "Interactive tag shows border changes between enabled and active states."
- Preview: Interactive Tag instance in Enabled state and another in Active state
- Columns: Spec | Enabled | Active | Notes

| Spec | Enabled | Active | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| borderWidth | 1 | none | Active uses filled background instead of border |

---

## Slot Content Sections

Components with native Figma SLOT nodes can have **preferred instances** — a curated list of components approved for use in each slot (e.g., a ListItem's leading slot accepts Checkbox, Avatar, Icon). When the extraction discovers SLOT properties with `preferredValues`, create a dedicated structure section per preferred component to document only the **hosting context and slot-imposed dimensional deltas** for that placement. These sections are **not** mini structure specs for the preferred component itself.

### When to use

Add slot content sections when:
- The extraction's `slotContents` array has entries with non-empty `preferredComponents`
- The cross-variant comparison's `slotContentDimensions` has measurement data for those preferred components

Do **not** create slot content sections for slots without `preferredValues` — those are unconstrained and don't have specific dimensional guidance to document.

If a preferred slot instance is actually a **parent-owned structural role** for this component, classify it as a `subComponent` instead of a `slotContent` section and document it fully on the sub-component path.

### How to structure

Each slot content section uses the same **section shell** as other spec sections (title, description, columns, preview), but the **row ownership rule is stricter** than a sub-component section:
- **Section name:** `"{slotName} — {componentName}"` (e.g., "Leading content — Checkbox")
- **Section description:** `"Dimensional properties when {componentName} is placed in the {slotName} slot."` Add cross-references: "See Checkbox spec for component internals."
- **Columns:** Match the parent's size axis (e.g., Spec | Large | Medium | Small | Notes)
- **Preview:** Instances of the preferred component at each parent size, sourced from the preferred component's own component set
- **Data source:** `slotContentDimensions.{slotName}.{componentName}` — contains `self` (the preferred component's measurements after auto-layout reflow) and `slotContext` (the SLOT node's measurements after content insertion)

**Allowed row types in a slot content section:**
- **Container / hosting rows** when the preferred component's placement introduces a meaningful hosting context to document (e.g., slot padding, contextual widthMode/heightMode, min/max constraints, alignment overrides)
- **Placement deltas** from `self` only when the preferred component's measured values differ from its standalone defaults **because of the slot**
- **Reference rows** like `"Text button instance"` or `"Checkbox instance"` with notes such as `"See Button spec for component internals"`

**Disallowed row types in a slot content section:**
- The preferred component's own internal structure rows (padding, cornerRadius, borderWidth, iconSize, label typography, internal spacing, etc.)
- Full `self` dumps that mirror the preferred component's standalone structure spec
- Repeating constant slot container rows that already belong in the composition section

### What dimensions to document

The `self` measurements capture the preferred component's contextual dimensions — use them only as a **diff source** against the preferred component's own spec. They are relevant only when the slot changes the preferred component's standalone defaults, for example:
- **Padding overrides** — optical alignment padding applied when the component sits inside the slot
- **Constrained sizes** — min/max dimensions imposed by the slot or parent auto-layout
- **Alignment overrides** — placement-specific alignment caused by the slot context

The `slotContext` measurements capture the SLOT node itself:
- **Slot padding** — inner padding of the hosting container
- **Slot dimensions** — min/max width/height of the hosting container
- **Contextual sizing/alignment** — hosting widthMode, heightMode, and alignment when these are relevant to the preferred component's placement

**Slot container property ownership:** The slot container's own structural properties (sizing mode, alignment, clipsContent) are usually constant regardless of what content is placed inside. These belong as **group rows in the composition section**. In a `slotContent` section, only repeat hosting-container properties when they are needed to explain the preferred component's placement in that specific context (for example, contextual padding or a constraint that applies to this preferred component and not the slot generally).

**Boundary rule for preferred components:** When a slot content section references another component's spec ("See X spec for component internals"), document only what is **unique to this preferred component's placement** — the hosting container and any dimensional differences from the component's standalone defaults caused by the slot's auto-layout constraints (e.g., reflow causing different width/height, padding overrides, alignment overrides). Do NOT document the preferred component's own internal properties from `self` (padding, cornerRadius, minWidth, iconSize, label typography, internal spacing) — those belong to the component's own spec. If the preferred component's measured `self` values match its standalone defaults, omit them and use a reference row instead.

### Design-intent notes

Notes for slot content sections should explain the contextual relationship:

| Instead of this | Write this |
|---|---|
| "Checkbox size" | "Compact density variant — optically aligned with primary text baseline" |
| "Padding" | "Inner padding for optical centering within the slot height" |
| "Width" | "Fixed width matches the leading icon grid across all slot content types" |

### Wrong vs right example

**Classification example**

- `Section heading -> trailing Button from library` -> `slotContent` section with hosting-context rows only, then reference the Button spec
- `Text field -> Label / Input / Hint text` -> `subComponent` sections, even if the parent uses slot-like composition to place them
- `Section heading -> trailingStatusChip` that exists specifically for this component -> `subComponent` section, because the parent owns that structural role

**Wrong — Trailing content — Text button**

- Section name: "Trailing content — Text button"
- Description: "Dimensional properties when Text button is placed in the trailing content slot. See Button spec for component internals."

| Spec | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Text button | – | CTA-style trailing pattern for the slot |
| ├─ widthMode | hug | Duplicates button structure |
| └─ fixedHeight | 30 | Duplicates button structure |

This is wrong because it restates the nested button's own structure instead of the hosting context.

**Right — Trailing content — Text button**

- Section name: "Trailing content — Text button"
- Description: "Dimensional properties when Text button is placed in the trailing content slot. See Button spec for component internals."
- Preview: Text button instances at each parent size
- Columns: Spec | Default | Notes

| Spec | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Container | – | Container hosting the text button |
| ├─ paddingStart | 12 | Optical inset applied by the slot context |
| ├─ paddingEnd | 12 | Mirrors the leading inset for centered placement |
| ├─ widthMode | hug | Adapts to button label length inside the slot |
| └─ heightMode | hug | Container height follows the hosted instance |
| Text button instance | – | See Button component API |

### Grouping and ordering

Slot content sections are grouped by slot (leading → trailing, matching visual order) and placed after regular sub-component sections but before state-conditional sections. Within a slot group, order preferred components by the order they appear in `preferredValues`.

---

## Interpretation Quality Guidance

The AI interpretation layer has complete, structured data from the extraction and cross-variant comparison. Instead of writing `figma_execute` queries, focus on high-value reasoning tasks that directly improve spec quality for engineers.

### Design-Intent Notes

For each property row, write notes that answer **"why this value?"** not just **"what is this property?"**. Use the full dimensional data across all variants and sub-components to identify scaling patterns.

| Instead of this | Write this |
|---|---|
| "Tap target" | "Meets WCAG 2.5.8 minimum touch target (44px) with 12px optical margin" |
| "Inset from edges" | "Accommodates multi-line secondary text at spacious density" |
| "Pill shape" | "Uses half of minHeight — pill shape scales with container height" |
| "Icon size" | "Matches platform icon grid (20dp Android, 20pt iOS)" |
| "Gap between icon and label" | "Scales with size axis: 4→6→8→8 maintains optical balance at each size" |

Use the cross-variant data to identify scaling patterns and explain them in notes.

### Cross-Section Pattern Recognition

After reviewing all sections together, identify and document:
- **General notes** describing system-wide patterns: e.g., "All sub-components share the `spacing-inset-*` token family for horizontal padding, scaling from 12 (compact) to 20 (spacious)"
- **Consistency observations** in section descriptions: e.g., "Leading and trailing content slots have identical minWidth and alignment — designed as symmetrical containers"
- **Cross-references between sections** when one section's values explain another's: e.g., "Composition section shows Label uses `small` variant at XSmall parent size — this is why the Label section's XSmall column has different padding than other sizes"

These observations go into `generalNotes` and `sectionDescription` fields.

### Anomaly Detection

Before generating structured data, scan the extraction and cross-variant data for:
- **Scaling inconsistencies:** A sub-component whose minHeight doesn't scale with the parent's size axis — intentional or a design bug? Flag in notes.
- **Token misconfiguration:** A token binding that resolves to the same value across all density modes — the token exists but doesn't differentiate. Note it.
- **Asymmetric padding without explanation:** paddingStart=16, paddingEnd=12 — optical correction or mistake? If intentional, the note should explain why.
- **Missing token bindings:** A hardcoded value surrounded by token-bound siblings — was the binding missed, or is it intentionally hardcoded? Flag for engineering awareness.
- **Stroke/border state changes:** Compare `stateComparison` data — does a border appear, disappear, or change weight between states? Flag as a state-conditional section candidate if not already in the plan.

Add anomaly notes to the relevant row's `notes` field or to `generalNotes` for component-wide issues.

### Completeness Judgment

Before proceeding to rendering, verify:
- Does every auto-layout container in the extraction have its padding and spacing documented in a section row?
- Does every sub-component discovered in the `enrichedTree` have its own section?
- Are there dimensional properties present in `rootDimensions` or `subComponentDimensions` that were not included in any row?
- For composition sections: does every sub-component's size mapping cover all parent sizes?
- Are typography styles documented for every TEXT node in the enriched tree?

If gaps exist that cannot be filled from the extraction data, add a note in `generalNotes`: e.g., "Trailing content slot dimensions not documented — slot was empty in all inspected variants."

## Data Structure Reference

*Use this structure to organize your analysis internally. The data is passed directly into Figma template placeholders — no JSON output is needed.*

Organize the data you gather into the following logical structure before rendering:

- **componentName** — the component's name (e.g., "Button", "List item")
- **generalNotes** (optional) — component-wide implementation notes (e.g., "Density controlled by variable mode")
- **sections** — one or more sections, each containing:
  - **sectionName** — descriptive title (e.g., "Button sizes", "Leading content", "Shape")
  - **sectionDescription** (optional) — explanatory text or "See X spec" references
  - **preview** — a brief description of which component variant instances to place in the section's `#Preview` frame; typically one labeled instance per value column, varying the section's axis while keeping other axes at defaults
  - **columns** — ordered list of column headers; first is always "Spec" (or "Composition"), last is always "Notes", middle columns are variant names
  - **rows** — one or more rows, each with:
    - **spec** — property name in camelCase (e.g., "minHeight", "horizontalPadding")
    - **values** — one value per middle column (length must equal columns count minus 2)
    - **notes** — brief implementation note (use "–" if none needed)
    - **isSubProperty** (optional) — true if the row belongs to a parent group
    - **isLastInGroup** (optional) — true if this is the final row of a group

---

## Field Rules

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `componentName` | Component name: "Button", "List item", "Section heading" |
| `generalNotes` | Optional. Use for component-wide notes about density modes, variable usage, etc. |
| `sections` | At least one section. First section is typically the composition section (structural overview). |
| `sectionName` | Descriptive name: "Button sizes", "Leading content", "Shape variants" |
| `sectionDescription` | Optional. Use for "See X spec" references or explanatory prose. |
| `preview` | Which component variant instances to show — typically one labeled instance per value column, varying the section's axis while keeping other axes at defaults |
| `columns` | First column is always "Spec" (or "Composition" for composition sections), last is always "Notes". Middle columns are variant names. Render order: first column → values[0..n] → Notes |
| `rows` | At least one row per section. |
| `spec` | Property name in camelCase: `minHeight`, `horizontalPadding`, `cornerRadius` |
| `values` | Array of values for middle columns. Length must equal `columns.length - 2`. Renders between Spec and Notes columns. |
| `notes` | Brief implementation note (3-10 words). Use "–" if no note needed. Always renders in the final "Notes" column. |
| `isSubProperty` | Set `true` for rows belonging to a group (shows "within-group" hierarchy indicator) |
| `isLastInGroup` | Set `true` on the final row of a group (shows "end of group" indicator instead of "within-group") |

### Group Header Rows

Use group header rows to organize related properties:

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| When to use | When multiple properties belong to a logical container (e.g., "Container", "Row container", "Icon area") |
| `spec` value | Descriptive name for the group |
| `values` array | Use `"–"` for all columns (no dimensional values for the header itself) |
| `isSubProperty` | Do NOT set on the header row itself |
| Child rows | Set `isSubProperty: true` on rows belonging to this group |
| Last child row | Set BOTH `isSubProperty: true` AND `isLastInGroup: true` on the final row of the group |

**Example pattern:**

- `Container` — values: – | – | – — notes: "Tap target" (group header, no `isSubProperty`)
- `minHeight` — values: 48 | 56 | 72 — `isSubProperty: true`
- `padding` — values: 12 | 16 | 20 — `isSubProperty: true`, `isLastInGroup: true`

**Visual result:**
```
Container          –      –      –     Tap target
 ├─ minHeight     48     56     72     ...
 └─ padding       12     16     20     ...
```

## Structure Rules

| Rule | Guidance |
|------|----------|
| Section order | Composition section first (serves as structural overview — no separate "container" section), then zone-specific sections in visual order (leading → middle → trailing), then slot content sections (grouped by slot: leading → trailing, one per preferred component), then state-conditional sections last |
| Column consistency | All rows in a section must have same number of values matching column count |
| Hierarchy | Use `isSubProperty: true` for properties that belong to a parent row |
| Value format | Use plain numbers without units: "48", "16", "full", "center". Use "–" for not applicable. |
| References | Put "See X spec" in `sectionDescription`, not scattered in notes |

## Value Formatting: Display Strings from Extraction

Both the extraction and cross-variant data provide pre-formatted `display` strings on every `{ value, token, display }` tuple. Use `display` directly as table cell values — no manual formatting needed. Both sources use identical formatting, so table values can come from either.

| Source | `display` value | Example |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Semantic token | `"token-name (resolved-value)"` | `"spacing-horizontal-xs (8)"` |
| Hardcoded value | `"value"` | `"8"` |

**Why:** This helps engineers know whether to use a token reference or a literal value in implementation.

**Note:** Do not include platform-specific units (px, dp, pt). Assume 1 px = 1 dp = 1 pt. Use plain numbers.

**Examples:**
- Token-based: `"spacing-horizontal-md (16)"`, `"radius-small (4)"`
- Hardcoded: `"48"`, `"full"`, `"center"`

## Common Variant Columns

| Variant Type | Typical Columns |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Density | `["Spec", "Compact", "Default", "Spacious", "Notes"]` |
| Size | `["Spec", "Large", "Medium", "Small", "XSmall", "Notes"]` |
| Shape | `["Spec", "Rectangular", "Rounded", "Notes"]` |
| State dimensions | `["Spec", "Rest", "Pressed", "Notes"]` |

---

## Common Property Names

| Category | Properties | Typical Values |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Height/Width | `minHeight`, `maxHeight`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `fixedWidth`, `fixedHeight` | `"48"`, `"sizing-md (48)"` |
| Padding (uniform) | `padding` | `"spacing-md (16)"` |
| Padding (symmetric) | `horizontalPadding`, `verticalPadding` | `"spacing-md (16)"`, `"12"` |
| Padding (per-side) | `paddingTop`, `paddingBottom`, `paddingStart`, `paddingEnd` | `"spacing-md (16)"`, `"12"` |
| Spacing | `contentSpacing`, `itemSpacing`, `gapBetween` | `"spacing-sm (8)"`, `"4"` |
| Alignment | `verticalAlignment`, `horizontalAlignment` | `"top"`, `"center"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"spaceBetween"` |
| Sizing mode | `widthMode`, `heightMode` | `"hug"`, `"fill"`, `"fixed"` |
| Shape (uniform) | `cornerRadius` | `"radius-md (8)"`, `"full"` |
| Shape (per-corner) | `cornerRadiusTopStart`, `cornerRadiusTopEnd`, `cornerRadiusBottomStart`, `cornerRadiusBottomEnd` | `"radius-sm (4)"` |
| Border (uniform) | `borderWidth` | `"1"` |
| Icons (size) | `iconSize`, `leadingIconSize`, `trailingIconSize` | `"icon-sm (16)"`, `"icon-md (20)"`, `"24"` |
| Icons (reference) | `iconName`, `leadingIcon`, `trailingIcon` | `"checkmark"`, `"minus"`, `"chevron-down"` |
| Slots | `slotWidth`, `slotMinWidth`, `slotMaxWidth` | `"24"`, `"sizing-avatar-sm (40)"` |
| Typography (style) | `textStyle` | `"Heading/X Small"` |
| Typography (inline) | `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing` | `"14"`, `"500"`, `"20"` |
| Overflow | `clipsContent` | `"true"`, `"false"` |

## Do NOT

- Use placeholder values like `<value>` or `[TBD]` — extract real measurements
- Mix different variant axes in one section (don't combine size and density columns)
- Create sections for variants that only differ by numeric values (use columns instead)
- Put detailed component internals in sub-component sections (reference the component's own spec)
- Add platform-specific units (px, dp, pt) — use plain numbers only
- Use inconsistent property naming (stick to camelCase)
- Show only the token name without the resolved value — always include both: `"token-name (value)"`
- Show only the value when a semantic token is used — engineers need to know which token to reference

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Wrong column count:** `values` array length doesn't match `columns.length - 2`
- **Missing hierarchy:** Container properties and child properties at same level without `isSubProperty`
- **Adding platform units:** Using "dp", "px", or "pt" — just use plain numbers
- **Over-documenting:** Including every property instead of the meaningful dimensional ones
- **Under-referencing:** Documenting nested component internals instead of saying "See X spec"
- **Letting extraction arrays decide section types by themselves:** `subComponents`, `slotContents`, and `enrichedTree` are discovery sources, not final section types. Resolve ownership first, then emit the section.
- **Documenting the same instance twice:** If an item appears both as a structural sub-component and as slot-related content, classify it once and emit either a `subComponent` section or a `slotContent` section — never both.
- **Empty or missing preview:** Not populating the `#Preview` frame with labeled variant instances for the section
- **Identical previews across sections:** Every section's preview must show instances relevant to that section's axis — a "Size" section should show different sizes, a "Shape" section should show different shapes, a sub-component section should show the sub-component visible at each size. Never use the same default variant for all previews.
- **Ignoring `display` strings:** Manually formatting `"token-name (value)"` instead of using the `display` field from extraction data. The extraction already provides correctly formatted display strings.
- **Wrong padding representation:** Using `horizontalPadding` when the extraction returned per-side `{ top, bottom, start, end }`, or using `paddingStart`/`paddingEnd` when the extraction returned uniform `padding`. Match the table row structure to the extraction data shape.
- **Physical directions instead of logical:** Using `paddingLeft`/`paddingRight` in table rows instead of `paddingStart`/`paddingEnd`. The extraction normalizes to logical directions — use them.
- **Missing variable modes:** Finding a token binding but not checking if it has multiple mode values (e.g., Density modes). Always use `figma_get_variables` to check if tokens vary by mode.
- **Missing typography composite:** Not using the `typography` composite from extraction. If `styleName` exists, emit one `textStyle` row. If inline properties exist, emit individual rows. Never both.
- **Generic notes:** Writing "Tap target" instead of "Meets WCAG 2.5.8 minimum touch target with optical margin". Notes should explain design intent ("why this value?"), not just describe the property.
- **No cross-section patterns:** Building each section independently without synthesizing patterns across sections. The AI interpretation layer should identify shared token families, symmetrical slot designs, and scaling strategies.
- **Ignoring anomalies:** Not flagging scaling inconsistencies, token misconfiguration, or asymmetric padding. The extraction data makes these visible — call them out in notes.
- **Incomplete sections:** Not verifying that every auto-layout container and sub-component from the extraction has its own section or is covered by a parent section.
- **Showing parent component in sub-component preview:** Sub-component section previews must show instances from the sub-component's own component set (`subComponents[].subCompSetId`), not the parent. A "Label" section should show four Label instances at different sizes, not four full Text Field instances.
- **Overriding preview frame layout:** The `#Preview` frame's layout properties are defined by the template. Never override them.
- **Missing border/stroke state changes:** Only checking whether a state adds entirely new properties, without checking if an existing border/stroke appears, disappears, or changes weight between states. The `stateComparison` data from the cross-variant comparison makes this visible.
- **Measurement labels for constraints:** Min/max constraint labels must include the prefix: `"min 32"`, `"max 200"`. Padding and spacing measurements use Figma's default display (actual pixel values) with no custom labels.
- **Extra annotations not in table:** Annotating properties that don't have a corresponding row in the section's table. Only draw measurements for properties documented in the table below — the token map gates which properties get annotated.
- **Missing icon/component references:** Documenting `iconSize` without an `iconName` row. When an INSTANCE child represents an icon or component from a library, add a reference row using `parentSetName` (e.g., `"checkmark"`) before the size row. Use `"–"` in columns where the child is absent.
- **Reporting measured pixel dimensions on HUG-sized containers:** The extraction returns both measured `width`/`height` and `layoutSizingHorizontal`/`layoutSizingVertical`. When the sizing mode is `HUG`, the pixel value is an artifact of current content, not a design constraint. Document `widthMode: hug` instead. Reserve pixel `width`/`height` rows for `FIXED`-sized nodes only. For `FILL`-sized nodes, document `widthMode: fill`.
- **Saying "See X spec" while documenting X's internals:** When **any section** references another component's spec ("See X spec"), only document the hosting context — the container or slot that holds the component (sizing mode, padding, spacing, alignment). Do not re-document the component's own internal properties (padding, cornerRadius, minWidth, iconSize, borderWidth) — those belong to the component's own spec. This applies equally to slot content sections, sub-component sections, and sections for default slot children. If `self` measurements match the component's standalone defaults, they belong in the component's own spec, not here.
- **Creating a separate "container" section instead of a composition section:** When a component has 2+ structural zones (slots, sub-components, content areas), the host container's properties (padding, spacing, alignment, heightMode) belong as group rows in the **composition section** — not in a dedicated "container" section. The composition section serves as both the structural map and the host container documentation. A separate container section fragments the overview an engineer needs to understand the layout.

## Applying the Principles

| If you see... | Questions to ask | Result |
|---------------|------------------|--------|
| Figma variant axis "Density" | Do values differ only numerically? | Single section with Compact/Default/Spacious columns |
| Figma variant axis "Size" | Same properties across all sizes? | Single section with Large/Medium/Small/XSmall columns |
| Shape variants (Rectangular/Rounded) | Only corner radius differs? | Section with shape columns, OR separate section if complex |
| Leading/trailing content slots | Are there slot-specific spacing rules or preferred slot content? | Slot content section per preferred instance, documenting only hosting context and slot-imposed deltas |
| Slot contains a parent-owned role instance | Is it structurally owned by this component, even if placed through a slot? | Treat it as a sub-component first; slot placement is secondary |
| Variable bound to spacing value | What's the token name? Does it have multiple modes? | Use `figma_get_variables` to check `valuesByMode`; if multi-mode, add columns for each mode |
| Hardcoded pixel value | No variable binding? | Format as plain number `"N"` without units |
| Container with multiple children | Do children have their own spacing? | Use `isSubProperty: true` for child properties |
| Property only exists in some variants | Conditional on configuration? | Separate section, not columns |
| Multiple unrelated variant axes | Would combining be confusing? | Separate sections for each axis |
| Nested component (Button in slot) | Full component inside? | Reference "See Button spec" in sectionDescription. Document only the hosting container (slot sizing, padding, alignment) — not the nested component's internals. |
| No explicit Density/Size variant axis | Could dimensions still vary by variable mode? | Check `figma_get_variables` for collections like "Density" with multiple modes |
| TEXT node in component | Does it use a text style? | Check `textStyleId`; if non-empty, document style name; if empty, note "custom" or document individual properties |
| Component composed of 2+ sub-components | Do sub-components have their own size variants? | Add a composition section first (Pattern A), mapping parent sizes to sub-component variants |
| Component with 2+ structural zones (slots + content areas) | Does an engineer need a layout map to understand the zones? | Add a composition section first (Pattern B) as the structural overview. Document host container properties here. Each zone gets its own section afterward for internals. |
| State adds new properties (e.g., border on focus) | Do these properties not exist in the default state? Does a border/stroke appear, disappear, or change weight between states? | Create a state-conditional section (e.g., "Input — Selected") |
| Behavior/Configuration variant axis (e.g., Static vs Interactive) | Do variants look visually different (borders, strokes, optional elements)? | Use the default configuration for the preview. If dimensional values are identical, document once with a note. If border/stroke differs, add a row for it. |
| Sub-component INSTANCE with its own boolean properties | Does `instance.componentProperties` have BOOLEAN entries? | Enable them all, inspect revealed children, document their dimensions in the sub-component's section |
| State variant with different stroke/border visibility | Does the border appear/disappear or change weight between states? | Create a state-conditional section showing the border difference (e.g., "Tag — Interactive states") |
| No size/density/shape axes, only functional axes (e.g., checked, expanded, on/off) | Are dimensions identical across all variants? | Still use variants as columns — shows intentional consistency. Never collapse to a single "Default" column. |
| SLOT node with `preferredValues` in `slotContents` | Does `slotContentDimensions` have measurement data for preferred components? | Create a `slotContent` section per preferred component, documenting only what is unique to that placement |
| SLOT node as direct child of the host container | Does the layout tree show the SLOT node as a structurally significant child (has sizing mode, alignment, clipsContent)? | Document the slot container's properties as **group rows in the composition section** (not a separate container section). Do NOT repeat them in each slotContent section — they are constant regardless of slot content. |
| INSTANCE child (icon, badge, illustration) inside a container | Does `parentSetName` identify which component is used? Is it present in all variants? | Add an `iconName` row with `parentSetName`, then `iconSize`. Use `"–"` in columns where the child is absent. |
| `layoutSizingHorizontal: HUG` or `layoutSizingVertical: HUG` on a container | Is the measured width/height a design constraint or an artifact of default content? | Document `widthMode: hug` / `heightMode: hug`. Do NOT report the measured pixel value — it changes with content. Only use pixel `width`/`height` rows for `FIXED`-sized nodes, or `minWidth`/`maxWidth` when constraints are set. |

---

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Variant has no spacing differences | Keep the axis as columns when it communicates intentional consistency; only skip if the axis is structurally irrelevant and would not help an engineer understand the component |
| Value is "auto" or "fill" | Document as `"auto"` or `"fill"` — these are valid dimensional values |
| Spacing controlled by variable mode | Use mode names as columns (Compact/Default/Spacious); note in `generalNotes`: "Density controlled by variable mode" |
| Same value across all variants, or no dimension-affecting axes | Still document in columns — shows intentional consistency. Use the component's primary functional axis as columns if no size/density/shape axes exist (e.g., checked/unchecked, expanded/collapsed). Never collapse to a single "Default" column. |
| Component has 5+ density/size variants | Document all; the template handles dynamic column count |
| Sub-component has its own density variants | Reference sub-component's spec; don't duplicate its structure table |
| Corner radius uses "full" for pill shape | Document as `"full"` with note: "Uses half of minHeight" |
| Value differs between platforms | Document the design spec value; note platform differences in notes |
| Figma shows decimals (e.g., 12.5) | Round to nearest integer unless precision matters |
| Token name unclear or ambiguous | Use the exact Figma variable name; engineers can map it |
| Optical measurement differs from actual | Document the actual values; add note explaining the optical result (e.g., "Optically 12 from outside: 8 container padding + 4 inner padding") |
| Composed spacing from nested containers | Document each container's value separately; note how they combine visually |

### List item composition section

- Section name: "List item composition"
- Preview: One List item instance per density column (Compact, Default, Spacious) showing row height and padding
- Columns: Spec | Compact | Default | Spacious | Notes
- This is the structural overview section for the component. Do not create a second standalone container section in addition to it.

| Spec | Compact | Default | Spacious | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Pre-Render Validation Checklist

Before rendering into Figma, verify:

| Check | What to Verify |
|-------|----------------|
| ☐ **Variable modes checked** | Used `figma_get_variables` to check if any bound tokens have multiple mode values (Density, Theme, etc.) |
| ☐ **Sub-components discovered** | The `subComponents` array from extraction includes all INSTANCE children found in the enriched tree (with all parent booleans enabled). Each has `subCompSetId`, `subCompVariantAxes`, and `booleanOverrides` pre-resolved. |
| ☐ **Cross-variant data complete** | The cross-variant comparison measured all sub-components across all size values. `subComponentDimensions` has entries for every sub-component at every size. |
| ☐ **Section plan validated** | The AI interpretation layer built, validated, and adjusted the section plan. Every auto-layout container and every instance that remains classified as a `subComponent` after ownership resolution is covered. |
| ☐ **Design-intent notes** | Notes answer "why this value?" not just "what is this property?". Scaling patterns, WCAG compliance, optical corrections are explained. |
| ☐ **Anomalies flagged** | Scaling inconsistencies, token misconfiguration, asymmetric padding, missing token bindings are noted in relevant rows or `generalNotes`. |
| ☐ **Completeness judged** | All dimensional properties from extraction are covered. Gaps are noted in `generalNotes`. |
| ☐ **Collapsed dimensions correct** | Padding representation matches extraction shape: uniform → `padding`, symmetric → `verticalPadding`/`horizontalPadding`, per-side → `paddingTop`/`paddingBottom`/`paddingStart`/`paddingEnd`. Same for cornerRadius and strokeWeight. |
| ☐ **Typography as composite** | TEXT nodes with `typography.styleName` → one `textStyle` row. Inline typography → individual property rows. Never both. |
| ☐ **Display strings used** | Table cell values come from the `display` field in extraction data — no manual token+value formatting. |
| ☐ **Logical directions** | Padding uses `paddingStart`/`paddingEnd` (not `paddingLeft`/`paddingRight`). Corner radii use `topStart`/`topEnd`/`bottomStart`/`bottomEnd`. |
| ☐ **Column count** | Each row's values count equals the number of middle columns (total columns minus Spec and Notes) |
| ☐ **Hierarchy markers** | Child rows have `isSubProperty: true`; last child in each group also has `isLastInGroup: true` |
| ☐ **No units** | Values are plain numbers without px, dp, or pt |
| ☐ **No placeholders** | No `<value>`, `[TBD]`, or placeholder text — only real measurements |
| ☐ **Section order** | Composition section first (serves as structural overview — no separate container section), then zone-specific sections in visual order, slot content sections (grouped by slot), state-conditional sections last |
| ☐ **Notes column** | Every row has a notes value (use "–" if no note needed) |
| ☐ **Preview per section** | Each section has a distinct preview showing variant instances relevant to that section's axis |
| ☐ **Sub-component preview sourcing** | Sub-component section previews use `subComponents[].subCompSetId` from extraction, not the parent's component set. Boolean overrides from `subComponents[].booleanOverrides` (all set to `true`) are applied. |
| ☐ **Preview frame untouched** | The `#Preview` frame's layout properties are NOT overridden — the template provides the correct layout |
| ☐ **Measurement labels correct** | Padding and spacing use Figma's default display (actual pixel values). Min/max constraints use `freeText` with constraint prefix (`"min 32"`, `"max 200"`). |
| ☐ **Table-driven annotations only** | Measurement lines appear ONLY for properties that have a corresponding row in the section's table. No extra annotations for properties not documented in the table. Token maps gate which properties get annotated. |
| ☐ **Composition section** | If component has 2+ structural zones (sub-components with size variants, or a mix of slots and content areas), a composition section comes first. It serves as the structural overview and documents host container properties — no separate "container" section. |
| ☐ **Behavior variant previews** | Default configuration only for the preview; border/stroke differences documented as table rows |
| ☐ **State-conditional sections** | States that introduce new properties or change border/stroke have their own section (detected by `stateComparison` from the cross-variant data) |
| ☐ **Slot content sections** | Every preferred component in `slotContents` with `slotContentDimensions` data that remains classified as `slotContent` after ownership resolution has its own `slotContent` section. Sections are grouped by slot (leading → trailing) and placed after sub-component sections, before state-conditional sections. |
| ☐ **Single-path ownership** | If an instance surfaced through multiple discovery paths, it was classified once and documented on exactly one section path (`subComponent`, `slotContent`, or composition/root-only). |
| ☐ **Cross-section patterns** | `generalNotes` includes system-wide patterns (shared token families, symmetrical slot designs, density scaling strategies) |
| ☐ **Component references documented** | INSTANCE children have an `iconName` row (using `parentSetName`) before the `iconSize` row. Absent children use `"–"`. |
